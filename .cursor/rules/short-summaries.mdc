# Keep Summaries Short

Default communication style: SHORT and concise.

## Good Response
- Added QuickCompare component
- Fixed 3 linting errors
- Updated AddWorkoutForm

## Bad Response
Long paragraphs explaining every detail and decision.

## Rules
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- State what changed, not why (unless asked)
- Maximum 3-5 bullets for summaries
- Be verbose only when user explicitly asks
